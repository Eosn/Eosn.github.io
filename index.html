  <p><i>"When people label other people as 'famous', they take away a lot of subtance that they have as a person. I don't like it. One of the reasons that I don't like the word 'famous' is because than people uses it afterwards. It's like: 'he was famous' or 'he used to be famous'. Like, I was a guy before, I was the same guy during it and I'm the same guy after it. People thinks they can label your life." - Harry Styles</i></p>
